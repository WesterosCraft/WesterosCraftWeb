One has a man’s face, one a woman’s. Just beyond is Scribe’s Hearth, where Oldtowners come in search of acolytes to write their wills and read their letters. There are half a dozen open stalls where acolytes wait for customers, there are stalls that sell and buy books and a stall that sells maps. The path divides where the statue of King Daeron the First set astride his tall stone horse, his sword is lifted toward Dorne (The East in this case). The left fork (south-west) runs beside the river. Further down is the Weeping Dock from where boat trips to the Bloody Isle (an abortion clinic, obviously, duh) are very short. Beneath the dock there are shallow waters in which gathering frogs is possible. Further down this path is the Seneschal's Court and a Septry. The Seneschal's Court is a rectangular hall with a stone floor and a raised dais at its far end and a door leading to the office of the seneschal. There are high arched windows with a bench beneath. Outside before the court there are stocks that are used as a punishment for acolytes and novizes. Following the path north-east from Daeron's Statue leads to the Ravenry, the oldest building of the citadel. Having been built by a river pirate once, the stronghold is only connected to the east bank via a weathered wooden drawbridge. Moss and creeping vines cover the walls, ravens walk its battlements and the drawbridge has not been raised in living memory. It is cool and dim inside the castle walls meaning the primary light source are small window slits. The yard of the stronghold is filled with an old overgrown weirwood, half of its branches are dead. The north tower is round and houses Archmaester Marwyn's chambers and a rare obsidian candle within. His chambers are accessed by going through the yard and up a few steps. The room is large and round. Books and scrolls are everywhere, strewn across the tables and stacked up on the floor in piles four feet high. Faded tapestries and ragged maps cover the stone walls.

All of the houses were built and furnished by hand and the rough estimate is around 4,000 structures. The Red Keep was completed after five detailed tests. Although the city has been rebuilt with better textures and planning, many guests still enjoy visiting the old city, which was a massive achievement for the server at the time of completion. Interesting features include the Targaryen statues, the sewers, the graves on Visenya's hill, the tourney grounds, the Dragonpit, and of course the Red Keep complex and our original Iron Throne. Many locations can still be warped to (just add the word \"old\" to warp names) and the moderators plan on keeping the city on the server for posterity.

The Rousemonts are a fairly novel house raised to nobility by Lord Joffrey Caswell.\n\nOn the way back to Bitterbridge from the Whitewalls Tourney, Joffrey's small party of three was stopped by a group of bandits, which saw in them easy prey. In the skirmish that ensued, Joffrey, exhausted from the tourney and being a poor rider, lost control over his horse, which bolted off the road, cross-country. Joffrey clinging on to the neck of the black stallion, tried in vain to stop the animal on its breakneck path. Several minutes later, a hedge knight called Scaled Olav had just caught himself a large carp in the loop of a clear stream. Before Olav could begin filleting his soon-to-be lunch, Joffrey atop the black panic came crashing through the undergrowth. When the horse kicked off to leap over Olav, the flopping carp on Olav's blue-and-gold wooden shield, and the small campfire, Joffrey's strength gave out resulting in him flying off backwards. Olav dropped his knife immediately and managed to catch the shaking lord. After Joffrey had explained, they hurried back to the road, to find the bandits stripping armor, coin, and weaponry from the bodies of Joffrey's guards. Olav charged the unsuspecting murderers, felling each man with mutilating blows from his war-axe.\n\nFor this act of valor, Joffrey promised the hedge knight to repay him if they rode back to Bitterbridge together. Olav agreed, and so when they arrived in Bitterbridge, Joffrey declared that for saving his live, defending the honor of house Caswell, and for making him miss out on the delicious dinner that day, he would grant Olav an unlimited supply of carp if he so desired. He was referring to an old estate, a fortified manor erected in a loop of the Mander, which had once been used for aquaculture, but had fallen in disrepair. The previous lord had died, childless, in the Blackfyre rebellion.\n\nScaled Olav, couldn't have been happier, his meagre existence as a hedge knight, was over, and his life as the Lord of House Rousemont had just begun."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"8c883de894c1","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"8c883de894c10","_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"Features"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"h3"},{"_key":"d361afd9827b","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"d361afd9827b0","_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"Rousemont manor and fish ponds"},{"_key":"d361afd9827b1","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":": A network of causeways and dams connect the Rousemont manor to the fishponds which have been constructed using the water and natural sediment from the Mander oxbows.

Mercifully, the projects surrounding Duskendale were much more recently completed, so it wasn't too difficult to sew these projects together with the lands surrounding Duskendale. This included but wasn't limited to the Mallery and Stokeworth forests to the West, and the Hollard lands to the North.\n\nWithin a week, the plots surrounding the market square in the South were down, and building commenced. Progress was swift, with new areas being opened and built swiftly over the first few months. Kulmen, was key in creating the cohesive style found at the dockfronts, as well as the main arcade leading up to the sept, so he deserves a shoutout for that. Wherermydragons also gets a mention for their critical help with the Dunfort and town sept.\n\nIt'd be fair to say that the majority of the town was completed within 2019, with 2020 being a prolonged renewal and quality control phase. 2020 also saw the start and finish of the Duskendale sprawl, headed up by Xeson and Luk.\n\nI think two important lessons can be learned from Duskendale, the first being that build leads shouldn't plot for the sake of having open plots. The demand for plots, and meeting this demand is a difficult thing to do and still maintain quality across the build. It's important to act deliberately, build not to fill space, but because it makes sense for that plot/structure to be there.\n\nThe second lesson is that we as project leaders and builders shouldn't be shy in updating things we once considered finished. Styles change as new builders bring their ideas to the table, and Duskendale straddled a period of us updating our building style. If the project leader wasn't willing to embrace the changes needed alongside our building team, Duskendale would not be anywhere near as beautiful as it is now. Commendations must be given to Endy and Nuggets for building an intimate team of Duskendale facelifters.\n\nConstruction finished in August of 2020."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"3d2f8f7c1a1e","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"3d2f8f7c1a1e0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Inspiration"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"h3"},{"_key":"f4115a703486","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"f4115a7034860","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"The castle was inspired by the Tower of London.\n\nThe town took heavy inspiration for its dockfronts from the Lowland towns and cities in North West Europe.\n\nThe view from the docks to the sept, through the main arcade was inspired by the view of Strasbourg Cathedral in France."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"71597364d380","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"71597364d3800","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Videos"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"h3"},{"_key":"1297dfaf73a0","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"1297dfaf73a00","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"The Project Showcase of Duskendale tells the history of the town."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"9386e9542ba0","_type":"video","url":"//www.youtube.com/embed/uJNF2fBwHDY"}],"house":"House Rykker","images":[{"_sanityAsset":"image@file://./images/8cd72d002c732f6c8005c3124b7a12c9221748de-1920x1017.png","_key":"kTqpdKC6","_type":"image"},{"_sanityAsset":"image@file://./images/6ec7c5a5a4d5af6947ce658ae6d9ce3885c3892d-1920x1017.png","_key":"aD6EbdIc","_type":"image"},{"_sanityAsset":"image@file://./images/ce96a5e02a6f9d57393598465b9e32f450d18f74-1920x1017.png","_key":"tPlAX7qG","_type":"image"},{"_sanityAsset":"image@file://./images/a83b4cfd169e4d0a0b842d6d91155218c326ef39-1920x1017.png","_key":"BGKYfOyI","_type":"image"},{"_sanityAsset":"image@file://./images/de3faf83e4ac01b6cca94b2270394b749f56fb0e-1920x1017.jpg","_key":"NvPk2pVa","_type":"image"}],"name":"Duskendale","projectLead":"Veggie","projectStatus":"completed","region":"crownlands","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"duskendale"},"warp":"/warp duskendale"}

The hamlet near Waxbridge was laid out with the help of Estoop.\n\nIn 2021, some of the earlier parts of the project were updated or redone. Most notably, the castle received a complete redo (the original version can still be found at /warp wickendenV1). The town and surrounding hamlets and farms were given a facelift as well.

The Tor was one of the castles (along with Ghost Hill, and Lemonwood) burned by Visenya for the actions of the Dornish in the Stormlands in 8 AC.\n\nDuring the Fourth Dornish War, Prince Morion Martell assembled his host at Ghost Hill and the Tor before sailing to Cape Wrath, where Prince Morion Martell was burned along with his fleet and host by the dragons of House Targaryen, led by King Jaehaerys I Targaryen.\n\n"},{"_key":"4c41bbe75e88","_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"Features"},{"_key":"4eb7096710ba","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"\n\n"},{"_key":"1cf7a29c49dd","_type":"span","marks":["strong","em"],"text":"Tor Castle "},{"_key":"016a90b63f30","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"- Rising from a large rock situated by the sea, the castle of the Jordaynes"},{"_key":"9ddeda1f7452","_type":"span","marks":["strong","em"],"text":" "},{"_key":"858821e98e95","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"rises with its numerous towers and walls.
